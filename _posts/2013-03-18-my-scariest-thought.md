    “Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live.”
    ~Norman Cousins

My scariest thought is loss and loss is inevitable. 
We will all lose relationships, situations, and states of being that we enjoy and love. 
I am afraid of losing people whom I love. 
It's scary to even think  that everything is fleeting, and eventually it all slips away. 
 
Very strange but true, I never get worried about my own mortality.
